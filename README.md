## Building

### Client, Server, Launcher (Windows)
1. Verify that you have the C++ and C# packages installed in Visual Studio 2022.

2. Download [THIS version of the plugin-sdk](https://github.com/DK22Pac/plugin-sdk/tree/050d18b6e1770477deab81a40028a40277583d97) and install it using [THIS INSTRUCTION](https://github.com/DK22Pac/plugin-sdk/wiki/Set-up-plugin-sdk). Set up your GTA-SA and plugin-sdk folders.

3. Open project_files/CoopAndreas.sln in Visual Studio 2022 and build every project (Ctrl+Shift+B).


### Server (GNU/Linux)
#### Requirements 
* GCC or LLVM Compilers 
* GNU Make or Ninja  
* Enet library (no need because coopandreas uses latest custom enet library in repo , check ``build`` and ``thirdparty-libraries`` folder 

#### Building using CMake 
copy and paste the commands below in your terminal :  
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -S .. -B .
make # or ninja if you use -G "Ninja" parameter in cmake
./CoopAndreasServer
``` 

### main.scm

1. Download and install [Sanny Builder 4](https://github.com/sannybuilder/dev/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

2. Move all files from the `sdk/Sanny Builder 4/` folder to the SB4 installation folder. This will add CoopAndreas's opcodes to the compiler

3. Open `scm/main.txt` with **Sanny Builder 4**, compile it, and then move all output files to the `${GTA_SA_DIR}/CoopAndreas/`
